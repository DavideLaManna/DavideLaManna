👋 Hi, I’m **Davide La Manna**.
I’m an AI engineer with a background in mathematics, currently working on efficient machine learning systems, vector search, and edge-ready models. I enjoy building things that are both elegant and fast.

👀 My interests revolve around **ML models**, **high-performance computing**, **vector databases**, **finance**, and anything that mixes theory with practical engineering.

💡 I’m open to collaborations on:
– efficient vector search and indexing
– generative AI for low-resource devices
– knowledge-driven systems (RAG, KG, hybrid search)
– open-source tools that push performance boundaries

📫 You can reach me at **[davide.la.manna97@gmail.com](mailto:davide.la.manna97@gmail.com)** or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-la-manna/).

Currently based in **Malta**, building, training, coding, and taking calculated risks.
