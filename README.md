👋 Hi, I’m **Davide**.  
I’m an AI engineer with a math background, working on efficient CV systems, vector search, and edge-ready models. 

I like building ML things that are both fast and useful, and I tend to gravitate toward **high-performance computing**, **vector databases**, and **finance**. 

I’m open to collaborating on vector search, generative AI for low-resource devices, knowledge-driven systems (RAG, KG, hybrid search), or open-source tools where performance actually matters.

You can reach me at **[davide.la.manna97@gmail.com](mailto:davide.la.manna97@gmail.com)** or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-la-manna/).
I’m based in **Malta**, usually somewhere between training models, writing code, and taking a few calculated risks.
